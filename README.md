I will use the 2016 Health and Retirement Study to answer two questions:
  1. Is there an association between residential relocation and loneliness among community-dwelling adults aged 50 and over in the U.S.?
  2. Does volunteer status moderate the assocation above?

I used the cleaned dataset for the analyses. The HRS datasets are publicly available on the official HRS data (https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/). I used Stata/MP 18.5 to clean the dataset. If you have questions about data cleaning process, please contact: ryubyeongju@wustl.edu

The variable names in the dataset are consistent with the HRS codebook (https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-policy/portfolios/aging-longevity/dataprod/hrs-data.html).
